      "text": "<h2>The essentials.</h2><p>These are the items I've curated that spark joy in my minimalist life.</p><h2>Photography.</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/dslr-cameras/d750.html\">Nikon D750</a><br>A good full-frame DSLR. I've had this for years, and it has survived backpacking around the world.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/camera-lenses/af-s-nikkor-50mm-f1.4g.html\">Nikon 50mm f1.4</a><br>I love this lens for isolating a subject. The bokeh is smooth.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/camera-lenses/af-s-nikkor-24-70mm-f2.8g-ed.html\">Nikon 24-70mm f2.8</a><br>Such a versatile lens. I've used this the most throughout my travel.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.sony.com/electronics/interchangeable-lens-cameras/ilce-6000-body-kit\">Sony a6000</a><br>This is my go-to when I've had to move fast and light.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.sony.com/electronics/camera-lenses/sel1670z\">Sony 16-70mm f4</a><br>The perfect lens to go with the a6000. A wide zoom range and constant aperture wrapped up in a light package.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras\">GoPro HERO5 Black</a><br>For when the elements get harsh. I've taken this climbing up rock faces and snorkeling in the ocean.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/iphone/\">iPhone X</a><br>The best camera is the one you have with you. For those spontaneous moments when I don't have my main cameras with me.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.wandrd.com/products/prvke\">Wandrd Prvke 21</a><br>I've been trying to find the perfect bag to fit my needs. I think this might be it. My gear is secure, and the expandable roll-top allows me to adapt to whatever the day might bring.</p></li></ul><h2>Computers.</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)</a><br>I still have ports! The sd card reader is so useful. This is where all of my work gets done.</p></li></ul><h2>Coffee.</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://aeropress.com/product/aeropress-coffee-maker/\">Aeropress Coffee Maker</a><br>I love my morning Aeropress brew. It's also small enough to bring on long term travel.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.porlexgrinders.com/collections/frontpage/products/porlex-mini-grinder-ii\" title=\"\">Porlex Mini Grinder</a><br>I need to be able to grind my whole bean coffee. Bonus points for packing nicely into an Aeropress.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.miir.com/products/coffee-canister-airtight-seal\" title=\"\">MiiR Coffee Canister</a><br>A bit large, but this does a great job of keeping coffee beans fresh.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://nz.keepcup.com/shop/press\">KeepCup Brew Cork 8oz</a><br>I love drinking out of the glass, and the cork band adds a bit of sophistication. I use this for home-brewed coffee and when I get a takeaway at the cafe.</p></li></ul><h2>Hydration.</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.kleankanteen.com/collections/insulated-bottles\">Klean Kanteen Insulated 20oz</a><br>The insulation is perfect for keeping water cold. It also prevents condensation when I throw it into my bag.</p></li></ul><h2>Everyday Carry.</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/iphone/\">iPhone X</a><br>Of course.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://bellroy.com/products/slim-sleeve-wallet/default/charcoal\">Bellroy Slim Sleeve</a><br>Keep it light and carry the essentials. The leather ages well. I've had mine for years.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/airpods/\">AirPods</a><br>So convenient! It's magic! I need to convince myself to get the AirPods Pro. Walking next to loud busses make me wish I had that noise cancellation.</p></li></ul><h2>Digital.</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/product\">Notion</a><br>I've tried other apps in the past to stay organized, and this one has made the most sense for me.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/\">Figma</a><br>This app is where I do all of my design work.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://lightroom.adobe.com/\">Adobe Lightroom</a><br>All of my photos get added to Lightroom. It's where I find myself falling behind in my editing.</p></li></ul><h2>Analog.</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/notebook-medium-a5-hardcover-251-numbered-pages-5-3-4-x-8-1-4-in.html\">LEUCHTTURM1917 A5 Dotted Notebook</a><br>When I want to keep it analog, the paper in this notebook is of high quality. The dotted grid helps me draw ideas.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"http://pilotpen.us/categories/fountain-pens/mr-metropolitan-fountain-pen/\">Pilot Metropolitan Fountain Pen Fine Point</a><br>I've grown fond of fountain pens. This one was my first. It feels premium and writes smoothly on quality paper.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.lamy.com/en/lamy-safari/\">Lamy Safari Fountain Pen Fine Point</a><br>This pen is what I use more often. It's not as fine as the Pilot Metropolitan, making it more forgiving on a wider range of surfaces.</p></li></ul><h2>Development.</h2><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">VS Code</a><br>My IDE of choice when coding JavaScript. I'm still trying to find the perfect theme. Currently, I'm rotating between <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme\" title=\"\">Material</a>, <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tinkertrain.theme-panda\" title=\"\">Panda</a>, and <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TimGrochowski.valley-vscode\" title=\"\">Valley</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.iterm2.com/\">iTerm</a><br>iTerm allows me to have split panes and tabs to keep my workspace organized. For consistency, I rotate between the same themes I use in VS Code.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ohmyz.sh/\">Oh My Zsh</a><br>Using the \"refined\" theme, I get a minimal aesthetic on the command line with just enough information to give me context on what I'm doing.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://gumroad.com/l/dank-mono\" title=\"\">Dank Mono</a><br>I look at a lot of code. Dank Mono is a monospaced font that I don't mind looking at for hours. I use this in VS Code and iTerm.</p></li></ul>"

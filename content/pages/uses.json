I've transitioned to using this mirrorless kit full time as I'm finding that moving fast and light is becoming increasingly valuable.\n* [Sony 35mm f1.8](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/lenses/aps-c-e-mount/p/sel35f18)\n  This lens lives on my a6000. I love the versatile focal length of the 35mm (52.5mm equivalent on the crop sensor), and the f1.8 aperture is amazing for low light and creamy bokeh.\n* [Sony 16-70mm f4](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/lenses/aps-c-e-mount/p/sel1670z)\n  The perfect lens to go with the a6000. A wide zoom range and constant aperture wrapped up in a light package.\n* [Nikon D750](https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/dslr-cameras/d750.html)\n  A good full frame DSLR. I've had this for years, and it has survived backpacking around the world.\n* [Nikon 50mm f1.4](https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/camera-lenses/af-s-nikkor-50mm-f1.4g.html)\n  I love this lens for isolating a subject. The bokeh is smooth.\n* [GoPro HERO5 Black](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras)\n  For when the elements get harsh. I've taken this climbing up rock faces and snorkeling in the ocean.\n* [iPhone 12 Pro](https://www.apple.com/nz/newsroom/2020/10/apple-introduces-iphone-12-pro-and-iphone-12-pro-max-with-5g/)\n  The best camera is the one you have with you. For those spontaneous moments when I don't have my main cameras with me.\n* [Wandrd Prvke 21](https://www.wandrd.com/products/prvke)\n  I've been trying to find the perfect bag to fit my needs. I think this might be it. My gear is secure, and the expandable roll top allows me to adapt to whatever the day might bring.\n",

When I began thinking about how I would rebuild my website, I always thought I would use a [Headless CMS](https://headlesscms.org/about). The idea of having a dedicated place to create and manage content was familiar since I was coming from [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). As I was transitioning to the idea of building with the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), a Headless CMS seemed to fit the API portion of JAM. Thus began my journey of finding the right Headless CMS for my situation. The two that I landed on were [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) and [Prismic](https://prismic.io/). Both provided enough from their free tier, both provided GraphQL endpoints, and both recommended by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) and [Scott Tolinski](https://twitter.com/stolinski) in their [Syntax Podcast](https://syntax.fm/) (such a great podcast btw ðŸ‘Œ).

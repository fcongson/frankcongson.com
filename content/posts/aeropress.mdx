Coffee has become a daily ritual. When I'm not using the espresso machines at work or having a barista make me a coffee at a cafe, I like to use an AeroPress as my brew method of choice. It's such a simple way to make a single cup of quality coffee (with the right beans, of course). Plus, the compact size of an AeroPress is perfect for minimalist travel (with a few extra comforts). There are so many ways to brew with an AeroPress which lead to the creation of the [World AeroPress Championship](https://www.worldaeropresschampionship.com/). To keep things simple, I've stuck to a slightly modified version of the original recipe that came in the box.

> 1. Bring water to a boil
> 2. Place the filter in the filter basket and screw it onto the AeroPress
> 3. Place the AeroPress on top of a coffee cup - I use my KeepCup Brew Cork
> 4. Grind one scoop whole bean coffee using a fine grind - I use my Porlex Mini Grinder at 5 clicks
> 5. Put the ground coffee into the AeroPress
> 6. Start the clock
> 7. Add water up to the #1 mark trying to get as much of the ground coffee wet and wait ten seconds
> 8. Add water up to the #3 mark and stir 10 times
> 9. Connect the plunger to the top of the AeroPress and wait for the clock to reach 60 seconds
>10. Begin pressing the plunger down slowly - This should take about 30 seconds
>11. Remove and rinse the filter basket
>12. Push the coffee puck out of the AeroPress and into the rubbish
>13. Rinse the AeroPress
>14. Enjoy â˜•
